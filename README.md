I'm using XAMPP Control Panel v3.2.4
-Host: 127.0.0.1
-Server version: 10.4.14-MariaDB
-PHP version: 7.4.10


**Running the Project**

> Install XAMPP
You can download here: https://www.apachefriends.org/pt_br/download.html
Now you need to start Apache and MySQL using XAMPP.

Put your PHP files inside the HTDOCS folder that is located in C://xampp/ (it depends where did you installed it).

After that, go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ and import the database using the SQL script
in assets/sql/lucas.php

Then you need to open your browser and type "localhost/YOURFOLDER".


> Obs: 
This is just a study repo thus there're a lot of comments.
Normally, we don't use so many comments because the code must be easy to understand even without them, if you need to explain everything about your code with comments it is not a clean code!
