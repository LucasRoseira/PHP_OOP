**Running**

1 - Install XAMPP, you can download here: https://www.apachefriends.org/pt_br/download.html;

2 -  Put your PHP files inside HTDOCS folder that is located in C://xampp/;

3 - Now, you need to start Apache and MySQL using XAMPP;

in this folder: ./assets/sql/ ;

5 - Finally, to see the result, you need to open your browser and type "localhost/YOURFOLDER";

> Obs: 

This is just a study repo thus there're a lot of comments. Don't see it like a serious job.
Normally, we don't use so many comments because the code must be easy to understand, even without them, if you need to explain everything about your code so isn't a clean code!
