# PHP_OOP
OOP course to recalling 

you can study here: https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-de-php-orientado-a-objetos/

I'm using XAMPP Control Panel v3.2.4

You can download here: https://www.apachefriends.org/pt_br/download.html

To run the project you need to start Apache and MySQL(I'm going to commit them database later)
You need to put your PHP files inside the HTDOCS folder that is located 
in C://xampp/ (it depends where did you installed it).

Then you need to open your browser and type "localhost/YOURFOLDER".

Obs: 
This is just a study repo thus there're a lot of comments.
Normally, we don't use so many comments because the code must be easy to understand even without them, if you need to explain everything about your code with comments it is not a clean code!
