# PHP_OOP
OOP course to recalling 

you can study here: https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-de-php-orientado-a-objetos/
I'm using XAMP Control Panel v3.2.4

To run the project you need to start Apache and MySQL.
You need to put your PHP files inside the HTDOCS folder that is stored
in C:// (it depends where did you installed it).

Then you need to open your browser and type "localhos/YOURFOLDER".

Obs: 
This is just a study repo thus there are a lot of comments.
Normally, we don't use so many comments because the code must be easy to understand even without them, if you need to explain every thing about your code with comments it is not a clean code!
